# ToneScan

The purpose of this repository is to synchronize all our source codes.

Different branches will be created for different modules. For e.g. Homepage, Login, Results, etc.
You can download and upload your respective source codes in their respective branches.

The main branch will be our final project structure. And it will be organized when all the modules are complete and operational.
